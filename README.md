# My first personal flutter plugin 

## Which accesses the native part of the device through platform chanel and returns its characteristics.
___
### Currently, only the getScreenSize() method is implemented. 
(:rocket::rocket::rocket: => :boom::boom::boom: => :construction::bulb::construction:)
### It returns the size of the main screen of the device (in my case Android and Windows is tested )
## Android device example: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93344751/203588659-76dcf999-f75b-46a3-ad0f-cb4cc594449c.png" />

## Windows device example: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93344751/203588844-ceda96f7-61e8-4cd1-8756-eba11849cc3c.png" /> 

### I am waiting for the return of :bulb: to further update this plugin!:sparkles:
## Be safe and :muscle::ukraine: !!!
